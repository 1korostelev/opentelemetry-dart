# OpenTelemetry for Dart

This repo is intended to be the Dart implementation of the OpenTelemetry project, with a 
long-term goal of being open sourced.

All contributions and designs should follow the 
[OpenTelemetry specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification) 
in an effort to be consistent with [all other languages](https://github.com/open-telemetry).
